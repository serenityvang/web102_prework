# WEB102 Prework - *Name of App Here*

Submitted by: **Serenity Vang**

**SM Game Fund** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

I added a search bar to easily search for games. I also added hover options for the buttons to allow the users to see you can click on the actual buttons. I added the dollar amount for the 'Top Funded Game' and the 'Runner Up'. I also changed the colors for the webpage itself to white, grey, and navy blue (this color for hover as well).
